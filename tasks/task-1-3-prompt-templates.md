## Confidence Scoring Scale
- **90-100**: Highly confident - Explicit data from multiple contexts
- **70-89**: Confident - Clear data from primary context
- **50-69**: Moderate confidence - Some ambiguity or inference required
- **30-49**: Low confidence - Significant uncertainty or weak evidence
- **0-29**: Very low confidence - Minimal evidence or high ambiguity

## Examples (Few-Shot)

### Example 1 - High Confidence Price
**Field**: `offers.price`
**Context Data**: Commercial context shows "€29.99" in price tag, Product context confirms same price
**Confidence Score**: 95
**Reasoning**: Explicit price data consistently shown across contexts

### Example 2 - Moderate Confidence Material
**Field**: `material`  
**Context Data**: Product context mentions "canvas fabric", Technical context missing specific material details
**Confidence Score**: 65
**Reasoning**: Material mentioned but not comprehensively specified

### Example 3 - Low Confidence Audience
**Field**: `audience`
**Context Data**: Product name includes "Women's" but no other demographic indicators
**Confidence Score**: 40
**Reasoning**: Limited evidence, requires inference from product name only

### Example 4 - Very Low Confidence Category
**Field**: `category`
**Context Data**: Vague product description with no clear category indicators
**Confidence Score**: 20
**Reasoning**: Insufficient context data to reliably determine product category

### Example 5 - High Confidence Brand
**Field**: `brand`
**Context Data**: Brand context shows "Stoic", Product context confirms, Page structure has brand markup
**Confidence Score**: 98
**Reasoning**: Brand explicitly stated across multiple contexts with structured data confirmation

## Critical Reminders
- Consider both data availability and data clarity when scoring
- Factor in field-specific extraction difficulty (audience harder than price)
- Account for cross-context consistency in confidence assessment
- Lower confidence for inferred vs. explicitly stated data
- Provide clear reasoning for confidence scores to enable review decisions
- Consider source reliability (structured markup vs. marketing text)
```
