- Preserve exact brand names, including special characters and capitalization
- Differentiate between country of origin (brand/design) and country of manufacturing
- Note corporate relationships (parent companies, subsidiaries, partnerships)
- Return "No sufficient brand context found" if no clear brand information is present
- Do not assume brand information from product categories or generic terms
- Capture certifications, sustainability claims, and brand values when mentioned
- Identify private label vs. national brand distinctions when evident
- Prefer explicit brand statements over inferred brand associations
